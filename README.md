# HackTheBox-StartingPoint

This is a writeup of the StartingPoint free tier boxes on HackTheBox

Throughout my writeups, I use '*****' to mark the beginning and end of questions and '---' to mark answers. '-' is used for steps I took to find the answer and '^' marks the beginning and end of notes.

I was able to complete all of these boxes in a night's work, but I learned throughout the way. I have used TryHackMe and other CTF sites before but I wanted to start out fresh after a little break from doing CTF's.
I have never used SMB or Redis before, but I did have a little experience with FTP. Throughout this, I was able to gain a high level overview of each protocol/system and reintroduce myself to these challenges. Hopefully this helps me in the future CTF's I plan to do.

I plan to upload more content from HackTheBox as I find time in my busy schedule to complete the learning paths and move into the different boxes that HTB offers.
