This box is also something I have little knowledge of. Hopefully I get a better understanding of it now.

Question 1:

*****Which TCP port is open on the machine?*****

- had to use --min-rate 5000 to get this scan to run quicker, also had to use -p- to get all ports and not a limited number of them

---6379

Question 2:

*****Which service is running on the port that is open on the machine?*****

---Redis

Question 3:

*****What type of database is Redis? Choose from the following options: (i) In-memory Database, (ii) Traditional Database*****

---in-memory database

 ^Note: in memory databases use memory for data storage, traditional databases use hard drives/ssd's. They are faster because they don't have as many CPU instructions^

Question 4:

*****Which command-line utility is used to interact with the Redis server? Enter the program name you would enter into the terminal without any arguments.*****

---redis-cli

^Note: install tools using sudo apt install redis-tools^

Question 5:

*****Which flag is used with the Redis command-line utility to specify the hostname?*****

--- -h

Question 6:

*****Once connected to a Redis server, which command is used to obtain the information and statistics about the Redis server?*****


---info

Question 7:

*****What is the version of the Redis server being used on the target machine?*****

---5.0.7

Question 8:

*****Which command is used to select the desired database in Redis?*****

---select

Question 9:

*****How may keys are present inside the database with index 0?*****

---4

^Note: Keyspace under info command shows the databases, select one and use keys * on it to get all keys^

Question 10:

*****Which command is used to obtain all the keys in a database?*****

---keys *

Question 11:

*****Submit root flag*****

---03e1d2b376c37ab3f5319922053953eb

^Note: use "get [keyName]" to get a key's value. In this case, use "get flag" to get the flag^
